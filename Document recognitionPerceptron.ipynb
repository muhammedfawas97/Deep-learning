On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

Jacking up the frame some more\\n(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden \\nplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to\\nraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring\\nfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to\\nundo the pin holding the spring pack together.\\n\\nThe spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head\\non the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...\\nI soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.\\n\\nFlipped the bottom spring and then...\\n\\n\\nI donno ...

A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\\ntorque spec ...\\n\\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \\nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\\n\\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\\n\\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \\nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \\nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \\nit back... hmmm...).\\n\\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\\n\\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\\nAt least it now sits level..\\n\\n-- \\n\\nE.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\\n\\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \\nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\\nNo problems with winds and curves. \\n\\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\\n\\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough\\nbmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise \\nrebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well\\nexpect the sucker to last 300k miles.\\n\\n\\nEver got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not\\npleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos\\nand VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.\\n\\nAs for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't\\nbuy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?\\n\\nShantanu Ganguly\\nSomerset (Motorola)\", '\\t.\\n\\t.\\n\\t.\\n\\nSince I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964.  That year,\\nthe Dodgers were several games out of first and I think finished sixth in the\\nleague.  This was kind of odd because they won the World Series both the\\nprevious year and the following year.\\n  \\n\\n-- \\nWarren Usui', '\\n\\n\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined\\nthe top flight only in the early \\'70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since\\n1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think\\nyou\\'re exagerating here.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they\\'ve had to play according to our\\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \\nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \\n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \\nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I\\'m sure that an All-Star team assembled\\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \\nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\\n---\\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \\nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\\n\\n(28-30=superstar)\\n(23-27=star)\\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\\n(13-17=NHL regular)\\n( 8-12=role player)\\n\\nFINLAND:  \\n\\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\\n\\nC-Jari Kurri........25\\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\\n\\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\\n\\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\\n(Obviously, Selanne\\'s ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\\n\\nSWEDEN:\\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\\nD-Calle Johansson...18\\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\\n\\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\\nC-Thomas Steen......18\\n\\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\\nR-Michael Nylander..13\\n\\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\\nL-Jan Erixon........14\\n\\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s\\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n', '\\nWhile I don\\'t read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar\\ninformation (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..\\n\\nI bought a \\'93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)\\nafter debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, \\nand Celica.\\n\\nCheck this month\\'s Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  \\n\\nMy criteria: a \"fun\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.\\nI thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.\\nThe Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don\\'t have an air bag.\\nDitto for the Mustang(also no ABS).\\nThe SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.

Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.

Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.

It's interesting that you should list Toronto ahead\\nof Chicago.\", '\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.', \"\\n I know that there wasn't other games on the schedule, but ESPN sometimes\\nshows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot.\", \"\\nIndeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the\\nfuture, the Marlins are in dire trouble!

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n\\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d put him about there too.  \\n\\nNote: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

A low GAA against good\\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\\nof comparing two goaltenders.\\n\\n\\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout.

FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either.

As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up\\nin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the \\nmajors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he \\nbecame Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation \\nas an outstanding defensive catcher.

There is only one way of determin-\\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\n\\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to be rude.\\n\\n\\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\\nindividual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of\\ncomparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per-\\nformance.\\n\\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.  There  is  no  new\\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \\nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\\n\\n-- ', 'Lake State/Maine in finals...WHO WON?

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \\nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \\nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt ain't nearly so simple as this.

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc.

The timing stank, but against\\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\\n\\n\\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn\\'t screened the whole night. \\nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\\n\\n\\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\\n\\n\\nAnd Hextall didn\\'t on Dionne\\'s goal? Please.

From all I've\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\", 'I am in need of all of the players wearing #77 in the NHL.

But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make\\na perfect throw?\\n \\nI strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't\\nforget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went\\nfrom last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/\\nTwins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant\\nrace when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I\\nwill never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading\\nin the right direction.\\n \\nOne more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,\\nbut with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the\\nEast), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they\\nlose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.\\n \\nCharles, a very enthusiastic Cardnials fan\\n \\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n  º Charles Rosen            º      THIRTY-FOUR TO THIRTEEN!!!    º\\n  º University of Alabama    º   NATIONAL CHAMPS!!!

The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.

But that\\'s OK, I understand you\\nhave a hockey background. Stats like \"plus/minus\" make RBI look good.\\n\\n\\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com', \"Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\\n  of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper\\n  from their vehicle :) .\\n\\nThe Particulars:\\n\\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\\n* A valid drivers license is required\\n* Suggested equipment:\\n      CB Radio\\n      Compass\\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\\n      Clip Board and Pencil\\n* No alcohol during rally\\n* For more information contact\\n   Gary (815)727-3415\\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\\n   Brian (708)979-6083\\n\\n\\n                                            __\\n              Instant                      /\\\\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\\\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\\n------|---------------------------------------------\\n Exit |              |             |         ^\\n 257  |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |       Rt80                 |         v', \"\\n[deleted]\\n\\n\\nKeep in mind this was in Massachussetts.

He\\'s got good power to all fields and rarely is he\\ncaught not ready for a pitch. \\n\\n  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to\\npractice his swing while \\'on the throne\\'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) \\n\\n  How \\'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman?

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

The keywords `Monthly Posting\\'\\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don\\'t\\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\\ndocumentation provided there.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\\n\\nrec.autos.tech\\n\\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\\n\\nrec.autos.sport\\n\\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\\n\\nrec.autos.driving\\n\\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\\n\\nrec.autos.vw\\n\\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\\na mailing list.\\n\\nrec.audio.car\\n\\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\\nso is mentioned here.\\n\\nrec.autos.antique\\n\\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\\n\\nalt.hotrod\\n\\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\\nperformance vehicles.\\n\\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\\n\\nalso not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\\n\\nalt.autos.karting\\n\\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\\n\\nrec.autos\\n\\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\\n\\n\\nCrossposting:\\n\\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\\n\\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\\n\\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\\n\\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\\n\\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about\\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\\nrec.autos.\\n\\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\\n\\nDistribution:\\n\\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\\n\\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \\nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\\nheaders, and on article content.\\n\\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\\n\\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\\nspread of misinformation.\\n\\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\\n\\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\\nto be supported in your area.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\\n\\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\\n\\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\\n\\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\\nquite useless.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Lemons:\\n\\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by\\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all\\n`brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\\nthe `brand x\\' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Flames:\\n\\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\\nof this posting):\\n\\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a\\nminute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work.  It won\\'t, and\\nyou\\'ll get exactly what you deserve.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can\\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\\nbald, unsupported assertions.\\n\\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\\n\\n\\nAsking the Question:\\n\\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\\nsend email, I don\\'t read this group\\'.  It is a much better idea to\\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\\nI\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\\nto this request\\'.\\n\\nAnswering the Question:\\n\\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang.\\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\\ndefending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time --\\nit\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly\\naddress the original question.  In general, don\\'t post in order to see\\nyour words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\\nself-righteous.\\n\\n\\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\\n\\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of\\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\\nof these topics include the following:\\n\\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\\n\\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\\n    radar detectors.\\n\\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\\n\\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue\\n    about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.)\\n\\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s\\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\\n\\n6)  `Buy American\\' discussions\\n\\n7)  `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\\n\\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\\n\\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\\n          Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\\n\\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com', \"%I say buy out Henderson's contract and let him go bag groceries.

But while\\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\\nall-round players in the NHL.\\n\\n\", \"\\nOf course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.\\nJust as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.\\nMy point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to\\ntheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.\\nI realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.\\nThere is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other\\npitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first\\nor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\\nmound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most \\nruns wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage\\n(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low \\nscoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many \\nlow scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.\\nOn the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,\\nI would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.\\nThey would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their\\nopponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that\\nyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.\\nAll I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers\\nlike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.\\n\", \"\\nI agree.  Home runs off Clemens are always memorable.  Kinda like\\neclipses and hurricanes.  They don't happen very often.\", \"\\nBut waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as\\ngovernment paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and\\nlengthy paperwork?

A Christian Pro 1000\\n: aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\\n: a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\\n: The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\\n: Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\\n: in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\\n: even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.\\n\\n\\n: Rich\\n\\n\\nThank you for your extremely lucid and well thought out observation.\\nNow when you get back on your medication, please let us know how you\\nare feeling. \\nThank you,\", '\\nCatcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.\\nThey have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem\\nspot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly\\npromising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they\\nwant to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!\\n\\n\\n\"A catcher\\'s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his\\n recent offensive level of performance.\"  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in\\n the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger\\n in two short years.

In the early 80\\'s with the\\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.

Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.  So the installation doesn\\'t scare me.  I just want to be certain that\\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\\n\\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \\nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \\nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \\nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \\nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \\nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \\ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \\nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \\nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \\ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \\ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \\nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \\nthe turn of events.\\n\\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \\nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \\nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \\nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \\nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \\nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \\npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \\nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \\nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\\n\\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \\napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \\nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \\nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \\nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\\n\\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \\ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \\nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \\ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \\nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \\nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\\n\\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \\nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \\nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \\nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \\nmistake.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \\ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \\nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\", '\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 has a shorter wheel base than the SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2, just a \\nthought.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\\nit\\'s hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it\\'s hard to find a kid\\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He\\'s from\\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\\nhockey for about 35 years.\\n\\n\\n\\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\\n\\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ...

Santa Rosa\\'s is a nice rink, but it\\'s in an older section of town.\\nDublin\\'s is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.

Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.

The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.

The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.

In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5', \"\\nMaybe I'm just a child of the 80's, but I really liked the Marlins' uniforms.\\nThe helmets shine nicely in the sun.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000.

The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \\nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \\n\\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\\n\\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \\nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \\nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\\n\\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\\ncould just be Ozzie.  The results:\\n\\n                           RBI-HR\\n         Years        Actual   Predicted\\nCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6\\nClark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6\\nMatt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8\\nSmith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6\\n\\nI think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that\\nRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall\\nand how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.\\n\\nMore later,\\nHarold\", '1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nKings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93\\n\\nThe third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against\\nthe second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of\\na non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.\\n\\nSymthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.

We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year.

I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.

Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.

He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.

After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \\nassistant general counsel. He became the league\\'s chief legal officer in \\nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ...

But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.

Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O.

But the demonstration of this\\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\\n\\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \\nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\\n\\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference).

He works\\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\\nto make the team next year.\\n\\n#3\\tDAVID WILLIAMS\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\\nGrade:\\t\\tC/C-\\n\\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \\'91-92,\\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\\n\\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\\n\\n#4\\tJAYSON MORE\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nAfter being touted as the team\\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\\nbefore \\'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \\'91-92, as he was not\\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\\n\\n#19\\tDOUG ZMOLEK\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB\\n\\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.', \"There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.

And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

Hopefully with the coaches stress on\\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\\nLankford and Zeile\\'s off year).\\n\\nI don\\'t know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \\nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \\nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \\nand we\\'ll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \\nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\\ndifference.\\n\\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \\nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \\nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied \"Fair.\"  I \\nremember it being in the \"They Said It\" section of Sports Illustrated.\\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\\n\\nGO REDBIRDS!!', \"\\nThis is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do\\nis to suspend Bobby Cox.

If I\\nhad ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every\\nplayer that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and\\nthen Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.\", \"After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that\\nMilwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard\\nrecently.

(Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly\\nno worse than Baerga defensively.)\", '\\n\\nI think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great\\nGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you\\ngave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue\\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \\nthan yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original\\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\\n\\n\\nI think at this point there\\'s a personal, emotional element involved here\\nwhich transcends Murray\\'s logical thought.  As outsiders, it\\'s fine for \\nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \\nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\\nround.

First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.

Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!!

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\\n\\n#10\\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\\n\\t\\tpick in \\'92 entry draft from Vancouver\\nGrade:\\t\\tA/A-\\n\\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\\nhis small size (5\\' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\\n\\n#15\\tDAVID BRUCE\\t\\tSeason: 5th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a banner \\'91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\\nshort in the Sharks\\' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\\n\\n#18\\tMARK PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason:\\t3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers\\' decision to unload Pederson,\\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he\\'s not considered a\\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\\n\\n#20\\tJOHN CARTER\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from Boston\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\\n\\n#28\\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nI don\\'t understand why the Sharks didn\\'t let Quintin play any more than the\\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\\ncamp before the \\'91-92 season limited Quintin, the team\\'s leading scorer in\\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\\n\\n#41\\tMARK BEAUFAIT\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\\nalthough it\\'s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\\nKansas City.\\n\\n#42\\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\\n\\n#44\\tMICHEL PICARD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B-/C+)\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks\\' bait in the\\nexpansion draft.\\n\\n#45\\tDODY WOOD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn\\'t give a grade at all)\\n\\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He\\'s not ready, and needs at\\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5\\' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.', '\\nBased on my experience with a \\'79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I \\nwould definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The\\nolder models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would\\nassume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some\\nif not all of the qualities of their ancestors.\\n\\nTwo major differences in the running gear (that I\\'m aware of) need study.\\nMy \\'79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have\\nindependant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and\\nmore reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The\\nindependant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy\\nthe typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle.

He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.

Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A.

Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.

I\\nwould welcome any opinions from those fans nearer their teams (in other\\nwords, *anywhere* away from a Toronto newspaper!)', \"As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\\nkill them.\\n\\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\\n\\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\\n\\n#1\\tBRIAN HAYWARD\\t\\tSeason:\\t11th\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tP (D)\\n\\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\", '\\n\\n\\nNot if you\\'ve scored four runs, you don\\'t!  Why strain even the best pitching\\nstaff?  Why not make it easier for them?  \\n\\nIn the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can\\'t compensate\\nfor a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the \\nwrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot \\nyourself are insurance against the \"Shit happens\" aspect of baseball.\\n\\nNot every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of\\nthe 70\\'s was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench-\\nPerez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.', \"from Dean:\\n\\nYes, you're right. After going home and reading the paper, I got the\\nfull details. That's what I get for making a post based on WDUQ's news.\\nI should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong.\", \"\\n\\n\\n\\nHow about Kevin Hatcher?

Call me crazy, but how about\\nTommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't\\nreally play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies\\nin the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,\\nif you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,\\nwhy not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the\\npast month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArbour or King.

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\\nmounting any serious attack.\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\\n\\nRoster Moves:\\n\\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\\nold, 6\\'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\\nup front as well.\\n\\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nActon-Brown\\n\\nGalley-McGill\\nYushkevich-Cronin\\nCarkner-Hawgood\\nBowen\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\\n\\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they\\'d be in the playoffs this\\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\\n\\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\\nof taking the shot he found Brind\\'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body should have been a\\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\\n\\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\\naway every rebound.\\n\\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour\\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\\ngoal for the team to focus on.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t38 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t67 1992-93\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tMark Recchi\\t117 1992-93\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t51 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t117\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t79\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t58\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t58\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...', \"\\n\\nWhy not?

Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.

Most of the other\\nmodels are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of.\\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn\\'t include domestic small\\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\\nroots.\\n\\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\\n\\nToyota Paseo\\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\\nMazda MX-3\\nIsuzu Impulse\\nGeo Storm\\nFord Escort GT\\n\\n\\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re\\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\\n\\nTercel -> Paseo\\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\\nCivic -> del Sol\\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\\n\\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors\\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let\\'s take another example: the\\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\\nmoney for this type of car.  \\n\\n\\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it\\'s market\\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\\n\\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\\n', '', \"\\nTrue 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this\\nbut I'll dump my impressions.

A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!', \"I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter?

My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?\\n\\nOn some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so\\nworn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.\\nTo date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy.

If for some reason I miss the shift window,\\nI lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless\\nshifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000).

In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's\\nonly a mediocre goaltender.

As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,\\nthen Berman.

There are two big problems:\\n\\n\\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles.

It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\\n\\t  being reported on WIP.\\n\\n\\t2)The hosts.

Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\\ndouble.)\\n\\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.

Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise.

Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing.

Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting).

Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note.

His equivalent\\naverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So\\nlet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level\\nof play.\\n\\nThat is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top\\nten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave\\nWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,\\nan incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better\\nthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what\\nMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;\\njust ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan\\nKlesko's MLEs. \\n\\nHe got more attention from the media than was warranted from his\\nbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.\\nThat is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The\\nmedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a\\ngood, maybe very good hitter.

On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they\\'re too\\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he\\'s a\\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com', \"\\nIf the tire has a leak you should fix it. \\n\\n\\nDoesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the\\noil when the engine is cool, i.e. not when you are at a gas station.\", \"\\n\\n\\nAll of this is fine.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}\n"
